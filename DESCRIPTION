Description: Executes spatial nonstationary Fay-Herriot models for small area estimation.The empirical best linear unbiased 
    predictor (EBLUP) under stationary and nonstationary Fay-Herriot models along with the mean squared error estimation
    are included. EBLUP for prediction of non-sample area is also included under both stationary and nonstationary 
    Fay-Herriot models. This extension to the Fay-Herriot model that accounts for the presence  of spatial nonstationarity
    was developed by Hukum Chandra, Nicola Salvati and Ray Chambers (2015) <doi:10.1093/jssam/smu026>. This package is dedicated
    to the memory of Dr. Hukum Chandra who passed away while the package creation was in progress.
